Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

# Introduction
This notebook is going to be focused on solving the problem of predicting house prices for house buyers and house sellers.

A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.

We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.

# Streamlit & Heroku

We use stramlit to built the app frontend. Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
All in Python. All for free. No frontâ€‘end experience required.

For deployment, we use Heroku which is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

# APP

The deployed web app is live at http://housepricepredicbr.herokuapp.com/
